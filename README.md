# Adaptive Robotics Using Synaptic Homeostasis

This repository contains the code and demo videos for the project on adaptive robotics using synaptic homeostasis and Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs).

## Overview

The project explores the application of synaptic homeostasis in the design of a line-following robotic system capable of autonomously tracing a predefined path at constant speed, despite various disturbances or changes in the path's curvature.

## Repository Structure

- `Demo Video.avi`: A video demonstrating the robot's performance.
- `Experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and experiments.
- `MyLine_follower_4_complexPath.ttt`: Simulation file for the line-following robot in CoppeliaSim.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- CoppeliaSim

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Adaptive-Robotics-Synaptic-Homeostasis.git
   
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd Adaptive-Robotics-Synaptic-Homeostasis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Experiment.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the experiments.

### Simulation

1. Open CoppeliaSim.
2. Load the simulation file:
   - `MyLine_follower_4_complexPath.ttt`
3. Start the simulation to see the robot in action.

## Demo Videos

Demo videos demonstrating the robot's adaptive behavior can be found in the `Demo Video.avi` file.
